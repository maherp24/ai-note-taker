# 🔧 Quick Fix: "Failed to Create Note" Error

## Problem
Getting "Failed to create note" error when trying to create notes.

## Most Common Cause
**Your database schema isn't synced yet!**

## ✅ Solution (Run These Commands)

### 1. Stop your dev server (Ctrl+C if running)

### 2. Sync your database schema:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

**Wait for it to complete!** You should see:
```
✔ Your database is now in sync with your schema
```

### 3. Generate Prisma Client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 4. Start your dev server again:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Try creating a note again!

## 🎯 If That Doesn't Work

### Check Your Database URL

1. Open your `.env` file
2. Make sure `DATABASE_URL` is correct:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@your-neon-host.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
```

### Test Database Connection

Run this to check connection:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

If it connects, you'll see your database details.
If it fails, you'll see an error about connection.
